<p>“Suppose,” said Thomas Huxley, “it were perfectly
certain that the life and fortune of every one of us
would, one day or other, depend upon his winning or losing
a game of chess. Don’t you think that we should
all consider it to be a primary duty to learn at least the
names and the moves of the pieces? Do you not think
that we should look with a disapprobation amounting to
scorn upon the father who allowed his son, or the State
which allowed its members, to grow up without knowing
a pawn from a knight?”</p>

<p>“Yet it is a very plain and elementary truth that the
life, the fortune, and the happiness of every one of
us, and more or less of those who are connected with us,
do depend upon our knowing something of the rules of a
game infinitely more difficult and complicated than chess.
It is a game which has been played for untold ages, every
man and woman of us being one of the two players in a
game of his or her own. The chessboard is the world,
the pieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules of
the game are what we call the laws of Nature.”</p>

<p>“The player on the other side is hidden from us. We
know that his play is always fair, just, and patient.
But also we know to our cost that he never overlooks a
mistake or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance.
To the man who plays well the highest stakes are paid,
with that sort of overflowing generosity which with the
strong shows delight in strength. And one who plays ill
is checkmated&mdash;without haste, but without remorse.”</p>

<h2>FREDERIC REMINGTON</h2>

<p class="centerbold">Monograph Number One in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<p>Remington’s life was as full of
vigor and action as his pictures.
Outdoor life and athletic sports
were always a hobby of his. When he
was at Yale he was on Walter Camp’s
original football team, when Camp was
practically inventing the American game,
and Remington assisted him.</p>

<p>Frederic Remington was born at Canton,
a little village in St. Lawrence
County, New York State, in 1861. His
father, a newspaper man, wanted to train
him to follow the same profession; but
Remington’s taste for dabbing at art was
too strong. In the Yale Art School he
picked up a little about art and a great
deal about football. He could not accommodate
himself to college routine;
so he tried life for awhile as confidential
clerk for Governor Cornell at Albany.
This job was too quiet for him; so he
threw it up and went out to Montana to
“punch cows.” Remington became a
downright, genuine cowboy, and his four
years in the saddle brought him the accurate,
minute knowledge of horses, Indians,
cattle, and life on the plains that
marks his work.</p>

<p>After roughing it as a cowboy, Remington
went to Kansas and started a
mule ranch, made some money at it,
then wandered south, taking a turn as
ranchman, scout, guide, and in fact anything
that offered. When his money was
gone his mind turned back to art. As he
said, “Now that I was poor I could gratify
my inclination for an artist’s career.
In art, to be conventional, one must start
out penniless.” So he made some drawings
which the Harpers accepted. The
material was fresh and full of spirit; so
Remington got an order to go west and
get up illustrations for a series of articles
on the life of the plains. He was lucky
enough to strike in on an Indian campaign.
His success as an illustrator was
so great that he never after lacked for
commissions. He even went as far as
Russia in 1892. Gradually people came
to know that a new and vigorous personality
had taken his stand in the field
of art, and that his name was Frederic
Remington. His sketches and paintings
of soldiers, Indians, cowboys, and trappers
were full of character, and came to
be known far and wide both as illustrations
and as independent works of art.</p>

<p>Remington brought all his subjects
fresh from life straight to his canvas.
He lived an active outdoor life, worked
hard, and was ever seeking for new material.
It was his dream to go to a real
war, and in 1898 he got his chance. The
well known playwright, Augustus Thomas,
for years a neighbor of Remington’s,
states that he called the artist up early
one morning in February, 1898, and told
him that the Maine had been blown up
and sunk. The only thanks or comment
he got was a shout from Remington,
“Ring off!” As Thomas rang off he could
hear Remington call the private telephone
number of his publishers in New
York. At that very minute the artist
was in his mind already entered for war
service.</p>

<p>The latter years of Remington’s life
were spent in various trips and in periods
of quiet work in his home studio at New
Rochelle, New York. There anyone
could find him&mdash;big, simple and good-natured,
modest and plain-spoken, working
out his vigorous compositions in a
large roomy studio most appropriately
constructed and decorated for his purpose.</p>

<p>His collection of relics of all sorts and
from all quarters of the world was
unique. Aside from his painting and
modeling, Remington was justly celebrated
for his writing. His descriptive
powers were vivid and telling, and his
stories, which fill several volumes, are
full of living interest.</p>

<p>Remington died very suddenly of
pneumonia on December 26, 1909. His
place in American art is unique. There
is no one quite like him. He knew his
power, and he exercised it with ease and
confidence. His work was his life, and
his life was with strong, primitive types
of men and with animals, all of whom he
loved. The epitaph he wanted for himself
was, “He knew the Horse.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">“WILD HORSE HUNTERS,” by Charles M.
Russell, a spirited picture of an episode
in the rough life of the plains, is the
subject of one of the intaglio-gravure
pictures illustrating “Painters of Western Life.”</p>

</div>

<h2>CHARLES M. RUSSELL</h2>

<p class="centerbold">Monograph Number Two in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<p>Mr. Russell belongs to no established
school of art. His work
is distinctly his own, and he is
known as the “cowboy artist.” This
does not mean, however, that there is
anything careless or hasty about his art.
He works with great care. His hand is
trained to note every detail of his subject,
and he has a memory that never
lets go. Several years ago Russell
had an exhibit in a gallery in New York
City which he called “Pictures of the
West That Has Passed.”</p>

<p>There was fine audacity in this. The
man who had never taken a lesson in an
art school and had had very little opportunity
to see fine art work, who had no
critic more severe than himself, took one
of the big galleries in New York City for
a “one-man exhibit.” Russell had the
courage of his convictions, and his convictions
were soon shared by art lovers;
for he took his place at once among the
best painters of the West.</p>

<p>Charles Russell was born in St. Louis
in 1865, and, like Remington, had a
deep-seated objection to the rules and
routine of schools. The most interesting
thing in the school curriculum to Russell
was “vacation,” and it was his habit to
add to his vacation privileges whenever
he could by playing hooky. When he
was fifteen he was permitted to leave
school and go out to the great wild West,
the land of his heart’s desire, and there
he began his real education. He was no
delinquent in that greater school, nor was
he ever truant; for when Nature became
his teacher and all outdoors his textbook
he showed himself a keen and interested
student.</p>

<p>He went to Montana when life on the
range was in its glory, and the Indians
were part of everyday existence. For
eleven years he rode the range by choice,
doing night work that he might have daylight
for painting and modeling. He was
ever possessed by a passion to reproduce
in color or in clay the rapidly shifting
scenes about him, and so, day after day
and year after year, he was laying a
splendid foundation for the great work
that was before him. He lived among the
Indians and came to know their inner
life, their hopes and aspirations. He
learned their sign language and customs,
and so is able to depict Indians as if he
were one of them. His great success has
come not as a gift of the gods, but as a
well earned reward after years of hard
and diligent work and close application.</p>

<p>For several years he was known in the
East just for book and magazine illustrations,
usually in black and white.
Then he went to New York and made
himself known as a painter.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell spends little time in the
East. Naturally he was gratified that
his work won for him an immediate and
distinguished place; but he was not of
the mood nor had he the time to stand
in the limelight. The great West was
ever beckoning him back, and every summer
would find him at some Indian reservation
or roaming in the wild regions
seeking passionately for the subjects that
he loved to paint on canvas or model in
clay. Other things interested him little.
Russell the man is the same as Russell
the schoolboy,&mdash;indifferent to books or
academic matters, but eager for the
things that have a living interest for him.
The bargain that he used to propose to
his schoolmates sounded the keynote of
his life, “You get my lessons for me, and
I will make you two Indians.”</p>

<h2>CHARLES SCHREYVOGEL</h2>

<p class="centerbold">Monograph Number Three in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<p>“Famous overnight.” In those words
Charles Schreyvogel was hailed in
1900. The sound of the words was
good and cheery; but Charles Schreyvogel
knew well enough that his fame
had been much longer than “overnight”
in coming. It was only after many vicissitudes
and disheartening struggles that
he came into the recognition of his colleagues
and the general public. When he
did win out, however, his victory was so
complete and so enduring that he will
remain always one of the most distinguished
painters of American frontier life.</p>

<p>Charles Schreyvogel was a New York
City boy, born in 1861, and was educated
in the public schools. He began life apprenticed
to a gold-beater, and later on
was apprenticed in turn to a die-sinker
and lithographer. His pronounced artistic
talents could not be denied, and his
private studies finally led up to an opportunity
to go to Munich, where at the
age of twenty-five he studied for three
years under Frank Kirschbach and Carl
Marr. On his return to America he
went west, and there lived for awhile the
life of the plains, the mountains, the Indian
agencies, and the army barracks.
He was fascinated with the wild life of
the frontier, and devoted himself eagerly
to the study of horses, Indians, and troopers
in full action.</p>

<p>Then began the story of “My Bunkie.”
While engaged in painting Schreyvogel
was in the habit of making sketches for
lithographers as a matter of bread winning.
Being sadly in need of funds, he
offered one of his paintings to a lithographer
who needed a subject for a calendar.
The painting was “My Bunkie,”
and Schreyvogel set great store by it.
The lithographer rejected it because it
would not cut down well to the dimensions
of his calendar. Then the artist
tried it out in one place and another, and
failing to get it published, he sought permission
to hang it in an East Side restaurant
in New York, in the hope that
someone might become interested in it
and buy it for at least a moderate sum.
To his utter discouragement he found a
short time after that his picture was not
even hung in the restaurant.</p>

<p>He was about to take it home and lay
it away when a friend induced him to
send it to the exhibition of the National
Academy of Design which was then approaching.
He did this very reluctantly;
for he had no hope in it. On the day after
the exhibition Schreyvogel rubbed his
eyes and read what seemed to him a
fairy tale. His picture “My Bunkie” had
not only been accepted, but was hung in
the place of honor and received the
Thomas B. Clarke prize, the most important
one that the National Academy
has to bestow. And so Schreyvogel became
“famous overnight.”</p>

<p>Schreyvogel made his home at Hoboken,
New Jersey, and during the years
from 1900 until his death he painted and
published many vigorous pictures of Indian
and army life on the frontier, all of
them fine in action and full of sentiment.
He made an arrangement with a photographer
near his home by which his
paintings were issued in fine platinum
prints. In this form, as displayed in art-store
windows, they have become familiar
to the public all over the world.</p>

<p>Schreyvogel died at his home in Hoboken
on January 27, 1912, and in the
spring exhibition of that year the National
Academy of Design, New York,
hung once again his celebrated painting
of “My Bunkie” in a place of honor as an
affectionate memorial to the artist.</p>

<h2>E. IRVING COUSE</h2>

<p class="centerbold">Monograph Number Four in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<p>Scattered here and there throughout
the Southwest in unfrequented
valleys along the Rio Grande and
on almost inaccessible mesa (may´-sah)
tops, buried in the sandy and waterless
Painted Desert, are found the villages
and fields of a people whom the early
Spaniards called Pueblos (pooeb´-lo), to
distinguish them from their roving neighbors,
the plains Indians, who had neither
fields nor fixed abode of any kind. These
peaceful, home-loving people lived in
great houses which they occupied in
common&mdash;terraced pyramids of sun-dried
bricks&mdash;and which were both fortress
and dwelling.</p>

<p>It is among this interesting tribe of
Indians that E. Irving Couse has spent
much of his life. He is not a native of
the Far West. He was born at Saginaw,
Michigan, September 3, 1866, and went
to New York for art study in the National
Academy of Design. From there
he went to Paris, and took a course in
art in the Julian Academy and the School
of Fine Arts, where his masters were the
great French painter Bouguereau, T.
Robert Fleury, Ferrier, and others. He
returned to America and established his
studio in New York City, where he soon
made himself known. In the years from
1900 to 1902 he was elected to the American
Water Color Society, the New York
Water Color Club, and the National
Academy of Design.</p>

<p>About this time Mr. Couse’s interest
became directed toward the life of the
Great Southwest, and he made a trip
there which so fascinated him that he
continued for years to visit and study
the race of the Pueblos. These were
most interesting and impressionable
years. He found a life new and full of
fascination among the Pueblos of Taos
(tah´-ose).</p>

<p>Taos is the northernmost of the Pueblos,
and consequently became the “buffer
state” between the fierce Apaches and
the no less warlike plains tribes. Warrior
bands from either side, returning
from a raid into the other’s country, were
sure to fall upon the inoffensive Pueblos
of Taos, either to remove the sting of
defeat or to increase the glory of victory.
As a result the Indians of Taos became
the most warlike of the Pueblo tribes,
and when the Mokis (mo´-ki) of northern
Arizona, long before the coming of the
Spaniards under Coronado in 1640, found
even their rocky mesa tops to be insufficient
protection against the marauding
Navajos (nav´-a-ho) and Apaches, it was
to Taos they sent for aid. Taos planted
a colony on a mesa top near them and
called it Tewa (tay´-wah). This colony
exists today, and speaks the Taos language,
not that of its Moki neighbors.</p>

<p>But for all that the barbaric chant of
the happy worker in the cornfields, or at
evening the low flute note of the love call
springs more easily to his lips than the
harsh war cry; for the Taos Indian’s
heart is in his fields and his home tucked
away in a canyon of the Sangre de
Christo (sahn´-gray day kris´-to) Mountains
not far from the Rio Grande in
northern New Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. Couse has followed the Indians in
their hunts through the mountains they
loved so well. He has listened to the call
of the flute in some mountain glade or
the player’s prayer to the god of the
waters beside some rushing stream. He
has learned the Pueblos’ ways of thought
and action, and has recorded much of it
on canvas. Living in such close touch
with the Pueblos, gaining and holding
their faith and confidence, watching with
deep understanding the growth of his
models from boyhood to manhood, he
has come as close to the spirit of the
Indian as white man ever can.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“THE SILENCE BROKEN,” by George de
Forest Brush, which pictures the poetry

</div>

<h2>GEORGE DE FOREST BRUSH</h2>

<p class="centerbold">Monograph Number Five in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<p>Mr. Brush is known as a painter
of other subjects than those to
be found in the Far West. His
portraits have great distinction. It is,
however, as one of the painters of the
Great West that he is considered here,
and in that field of art he ranks among
the very first.</p>

<p>He was born at Shelbyville, Tennessee,
in September, 1855. He studied in Paris,
and was a pupil of the great Gérôme.
Some say that his work shows the influence
of his master, especially in the
trim finish of his technic and in his fondness
for embodying a story in his pictures.
Unlike Gérôme, however, Brush
did not search the classics nor the life of
the Far East for subjects. We find no
Roman chariot races nor scenes from
Scripture on his canvases. His thoughts
were always of his country, and he found
his material in the North American Indians.
In doing so he took a position
among painters of western life that is
peculiarly his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Brush is a thoughtful student,
with a fine, poetic imagination. Interest
drew him to the Indians. His desire was
to discover “in their present condition a
clue to their past.” As one appreciative
critic has put it, “he attempted to recreate
the spacious, empty world in
which they lived a life that was truly
primitive, unmixed with any alloy of the
white man’s bringing; and to interpret
not only the externals of their life, but
its inwardness, as with mingled stolidity
and simplicity these men-children looked
out upon the phenomena of nature,
fronted the mystery of death, and peered
into the stirrings of their own souls.”</p>

<p>Take the very picture that accompanies
this description, “The Silence
Broken,” for example. A swan has
burst from a bank of foliage immediately
above the head of an Indian in a canoe.
We are conscious of the rush of sound,
vibrating through the vast isolation. The
Indian looks up, but does not cease his
paddling. He kneels in the boat, “a
figure of monumental composure.” It is
in pictures like this that Brush conveys
in eloquent terms on canvas an impression
of the solemn romance of those
primitive human creatures.</p>

<p>Mr. Brush has his studio in New York
City, and usually spends his summer in
New Hampshire. His work will receive attention
again in The Mentor when the portrait
painters of America are considered.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“AN ARGUMENT WITH THE SHERIFF,”

<h2>WILLIAM R. LEIGH</h2>

<p class="centerbold">Monograph Number Six in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<p>As the Irish would say, the best way
to tell about a man is to let him
tell about himself. Mr. Leigh,
who was born in West Virginia in 1866,
has been well known for years as a magazine
and book illustrator, and has lately
come into a new renown as a painter of
great western pictures. He tells his own
story in a very simple, straightforward
way:</p>

<p>“On my father’s plantation my earliest
recollections,” he says, “are of drawing
animals on slate or cutting them out of
paper. For one of the latter I was
awarded a prize of a dollar at a county
fair, when four or five years old. I began
drawing from nature at ten, and at
twelve was awarded $100 by the great
art collector, Mr. Corcoran, of Washington,
after he had seen a drawing I had
made of a dog. At fourteen I went to
Baltimore and studied in the Maryland
Institute for three years. I got first
awards each year in the school, and in
the winter of the third year was appointed
teacher of drawing in the night
school. At this time Mr. Corcoran gave
me another $100.</p>

<p>“At seventeen I went to Munich, Bavaria,
and worked one year under Professor
Rouffe in the antique class, then
two years under Professor Gyses in the
nature class, and one year in what was
called the ‘painting school,’ gaining three
bronze medals altogether.</p>

<p>“At this time I was forced to go back
to America and start to make my living.
I spent a year in Baltimore, and saved
up $300, with which I returned to Munich
and the ‘painting school.’ In the
middle of the winter when my funds
were exhausted I went out looking for
employment. It was not to be had for
months; but during the following spring
I was engaged by an artist to help him
with some mural pictures. He did me
out of almost everything I had, and left
me destitute and in debt.</p>

<p>“However, sometime after this I got
work with Philip Fleisch to help him on
a cyclorama which represented the Battle
of Waterloo. Fleisch found me useful
enough to advance me sufficient money
to get through the year so that I might
help him the following season on another
cyclorama. I entered the composition
school of the Academy, painted a picture
which gained me a silver medal, the highest
award in the Academy, and an honorable
mention in the Paris Salon. I sold
that picture for $1,000, and it is now in
Denver, Colorado. Five more years were
occupied in painting five more cycloramas
and some pictures in between, one
of which gained me a second silver medal
from the Academy.</p>

<p>“Overwork had by this time got me
into bad health, and I returned to New
York, where I soon recovered. I worked
for several years in New York, painting
many portraits, two of which hang in
Washington Lee University, also many
pictures both landscape and figure, and
a great deal of magazine and book illustrating.
Latterly I have turned my attention
to the Far West in response to
a desire that has been in me since boyhood.”</p>

<p>The present generation has taken its pictures of life in the Far West
mainly through the paintings of such artists as Frederic Remington,
Charles M. Russell, Charles Schreyvogel, and others who will be
referred to in this article. And yet two of these men&mdash;Remington and
Schreyvogel&mdash;who were our contemporaries are already dead, and it was
only about eighty-four years ago that the first American artists went to
the land of the setting sun to paint the Indian in his native lair. This
artist was a young Philadelphian named George Catlin, a lawyer by profession,
who was born in 1796 and died in 1872. Though trained for the
bar, his artistic tendencies were too strong for him. He set forth in 1830,
with practically no knowledge of the technic of art, going as a guest of
Governor Clark of St. Louis, then United States superintendent of Indian
affairs. Governor Clark went for the purpose of arranging treaties with
the Winnebagos, Menominees, Shawanos, Foxes, and others, and the
opportunities for young Catlin were unusual.</p>

<h3>CATLIN AND CARY, THE PIONEER PAINTERS</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 209px;">

<img src="images/illus16.jpg" width="209" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">ONE OF CATLIN’S INDIANS</p>

</div>

<p>A second trip the next season inspired Catlin to still a third, in 1832,
when he ascended the Missouri on a steamer, to the mouth of the Yellowstone.
He returned some two thousand miles in a canoe with a companion,
and on the trip sketches were made of the Crows, Blackfeet,
Sioux, and Iowas. It was all a revelation to Catlin, who made a serious
study of the savage as far as his artistic equipment permitted. Subsequent
trips followed, and in 1836 he accompanied a detachment of the
first regiment of Mounted Dragoons to the Comanches and other tribes.
These visits of course were at a time when the Indians were in a primitive
and picturesque condition, before the change that was to come subsequently
through association with the whites. The result was an enormous
collection of drawings and paintings, together with many written accounts
and descriptions of manners and customs, and for years Catlin reigned
supreme in a field that no one had hitherto explored.</p>

<p>Catlin, however, was far more interesting from a historical standpoint
than from any artistic conception he gave to his theme. With
his indifferent training, unfortunately, he lacked imagination. He
recorded what he saw, then a great novelty to the public; but his
work now arouses little emotion. For years, however, engravings of
his drawings, colored reproductions, and photographs were the only
data for reference, and as the artist was scrupulously correct in all
details of adornment, local color, costume and implements, manner of
life and ceremonials, his work still has considerable value. The modern
men do not by any means scorn taking a hint from him. In the Centennial
Exhibition in 1876, a great showing of Catlin’s work was more
or less in the nature of a sensation.</p>

<p>The next painter of the West was William de la M. Cary, who in 1861
made a trip across the plains with an army officer. There was still plenty
of excitement, and the traveler had to be prepared against both wild man
and beast. Mr. Cary made many sketches in the manner of Catlin, and
sent home illustrations to the magazines, occasionally recording the humorous
side of his adventures. His sketches
were well received and appreciated.</p>

<h3>GEORGE DE FOREST BRUSH</h3>

<p>Some years ago George de Forest Brush
gave considerable attention to the life of
the Indian, and signed many pictures that
remain classics in American art. Some of
the themes were of the early Aztecs.
Among the titles were “The Sculptor and
the King” and “Aztec Sculptor.” More
modern works were “The Silence Broken,”
“Mourning Her Brave,” “Indian Hunter,”
and many more, all of them works of fine
imagination and admirable composition
lines. Mr. Brush, who was born in Tennessee
in 1855, was a pupil of the Paris
government art school under the late
J. L. Gérôme (zhay-romé), and is a distinguished
draftsman as he is a commanding figure in American art. Of
recent years, however, he has chosen other fields in which to exploit his
talent; but of all the native painters, he has brought to his work on the
Indian the best artistic equipment of any, and of the dozen subjects of
the aborigines all are unusual, and of the highest excellence.</p>

<h3>REMINGTON AND THE SPIRIT OF THE WEST</h3>

<p>The painters of the Great West, however, were yet to come. Men
were to arrive who would catch something of the spirit of the life there,
who were to record the romance of the savage, the soldier, the cowboy;
the latter in particular,&mdash;a picturesque group of men the outcome of peculiar
conditions, men who rounded up the cattle, and were apparently a
race apart, of prodigious recklessness, hardihood, and bravery, who lived
in the saddle almost continuously, save when occasionally they strayed
into the frontier town to squander their pay. These were, as the late
Frederic Remington quaintly phrased it, “Men with the bark on.” Remington
(1861-1909) was himself to be the first of the modern group to
treat the West with artistic sympathy, and his name rises instantly when
any mention is made of the plains. First of all, the man himself was a
genuine lover of the open, of nature in its wildest aspects. For him the
horse, the prairie, the blue sky! He should have been an army officer.
He was, almost; for he accompanied the troops on many of their campaigns
and was as well known to the captains as he was to the troopers
and many of the Indians.</p>

<p class="caption">FREDERIC REMINGTON</p>

</div>

<p>Somewhere about the middle ’80’s he began to send illustrations to the
various periodicals; crude affairs, as he admitted later and himself characterized
as “half-baked.” But they had that vital, convincing touch to
them that meant subsequent success. Somehow, even in his tentative
efforts, he had a vim and go that held the spectator. The man knew his
Indian, soldier, cowboy, hunter, from the ground up. They had in them
plenty of red blood, even though the first drawings were crude. There
was that about them which disclosed astonishing feeling, clear insight into
character, distinct sympathy. The public was profoundly interested, and
saw great promise. Nor was there any disappointment; for the man
made rapid progress. His Indian fairly
reeked of savagery; his soldier was an epitome
of the hard-working, modest, simple,
splendid man of action; his cowboy was a
picturesque and vital character.</p>

<p>It is almost pathetic to realize that so
commonplace and commercial an invention
as a wire fence was the means of doing
away with the cowboy. This introduction
of a cheap and effective means of coralling
the animals at one fell swoop put the cowboy
out of business, destroyed forever the
usefulness of this race of picturesque, hard-riding,
reckless youth of the plains. Mr.
Cowboy rides on his raids but seldom now.</p>

<p>Remington knew these cowboys well. He
had mingled with them, ridden after the
herds, joined in their boisterous revels, and
there came from his brush and pencil a
picturesque lot of out-of-door characters,
to the very life. Remington had camped
in the open, had ridden hard and long, had
been with the United States cavalry in its
expeditions, was the intimate of the officers and men of the then little
army of this nation, and he saw history made. In all this crowd there
was no more picturesque figure, whether cowboy, Indian, or soldier, than
Remington himself. He wrote as entertainingly as he painted, and before
his death (he was stricken untimely) was to follow his beloved comrades
in the army as war correspondent to Cuba, in the Spanish War. It is
nowise to the disparagement of the men who followed Remington to say
that they were all under an everlasting debt of gratitude to him for his
initial insight into the breezy outlook on life in the Far West, and for his
way of presenting his facts.</p>

<p>Remington was an indefatigable worker, constantly filling his sketch-book
with notes, and making mental memoranda of the happenings about
him. And he showed steady progress in the technic of his art, each succeeding
picture disclosing
genuine advance.
Nor was he
content simply with
painting and drawing.
He sought artistic
expression in
sculpture too, modeling
much during
the later years of
his life with great
success. Personally,
the man was a
delight to a host of
friends, with his inimitable
stories, his
genial manner, and
his thorough naturalness. One of the best known of his sculptural works
is “The Broncho Buster,” which has long been a public favorite, and
been reproduced in bronze.</p>

<h3>RUSSELL, THE COWBOY ARTIST</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">A DANGEROUS CRIPPLE</p>

<p class="caption">By Charles M. Russell</p>

</div>

<p>There followed Remington an artist very distinctive of the soil, one
who was of the land in that he had been a veritable cowboy, knew his
West thoroughly, had lived with the Indians, spoke several of the tribal
languages, and, still more useful accomplishment, was familiar with that
picturesque, poetic, universal means of communication among savages
of the Great West, the sign language.
This was Charles M. Russell (1865). In
Great Falls, Montana, where he lives
and has a home and studio, he is one of
the institutions. Few travelers in that
part of this country fail to pay him
a visit. They call him the “Cowboy
Painter,” and with reason; for during
several years he followed that profession.
Also he lived long among the
Indians, sharing their camps, their food,
riding after game, winter and summer,
dwelling with them as a brother.</p>

<p class="caption">CHARLES M. RUSSELL</p>

<p class="caption">The Cowboy Artist</p>

</div>

<p>Though he always drew pictures, he
never saw the inside of an art school,
nor had he ever a teacher. Artistically,
like Topsy, he <i>just grew</i>. He cannot
recollect the time when a lead pencil did
not seem part of his equipment, and he filled
sketchbooks with notes. Somewhere about 1892
he concluded to take up seriously the profession
of artist, and turned his attention to illustrative
work. Among his efforts in this direction were
drawings for Stewart Edward White’s delightful
“Arizona Nights,” Emerson Hough’s “Story of
the Outlaw,” and Wheeler’s “Trail of Lewis
and Clark.”</p>

<p>Russell went from St. Louis, his birthplace,
to Montana when he was but a lad, so that he
learned much of woodcraft and the ways of the
plainsman. Today there are few who excel him
in throwing the lariat; he is an adept with the
pistol; horses are second nature to him; buffaloes
he hunted and killed by the hundred in earlier
days. So it will be seen that when Mr. Russell
started in to paint the West he was reasonably
well equipped and rendered whereof he knew.</p>

<p>Since some years now stern men in blue and
khaki have seen to it that the Indian is kept on
his reservation; business men with the wire fences now look after the
interests of investors in ranch property; life in the West has lost much
of its picturesqueness; civilization and order control affairs. But Russell’s
memory of all these earlier conditions remains. So distinctly were
his first illustrations of the soil that they attracted the attention of some
of the English weeklies, which made arrangements for his work. From
this to painting was an easy transition. No one was more surprised at
his sudden success than the artist himself, who had drawn these pictures
because of his great love of the work and to whom financial gain was the
last consideration.</p>

<p>So it came about that Mr. Russell turned his attention to compositions
of various sorts,&mdash;the lassoing of cattle, the intimate glimpses of Indian
life, the ways of the cowboys, and occasionally episodes of army life.
They were all true transcripts, painted with considerable sympathy and
enthusiasm. Many of his pictures found favor in England, titled people
of that nation hunting in the West regarding these canvases not only
entertaining but as remarkably faithful. He has been spoken of as the
painter of the “West that has Passed.” Like Remington, Mr. Russell has
attempted with no little success the task of representing by sculpture
some of the Indians and animals of the plains.</p>

<h3>SCHREYVOGEL’S “MY BUNKIE”</h3>

<p class="caption">CHARLES SCHREYVOGEL</p>

</div>

<p>During the exhibition at the National Academy of Design in New
York in 1900 a young painter awoke one fine morning to find himself
famous. He was a youth of German extraction by the name of Charles
Schreyvogel (1861-1912), and his painting, “My Bunkie,” was the sensation
of the display. It was an episode of the United States army campaign
against the Indians, a cavalryman rescuing his chum, whom he had drawn
up on his horse. Another painter of western life had appeared, and had
made astonishingly good. Schreyvogel followed this picture with many
more of no less excellence. He painted the life of the plains,&mdash;the Indian
hunting the buffalo, attacking settlers, at his war dance, the fighting of the
American trooper,&mdash;in short, he disclosed a fine pictorial insight in that
wild and stirring life that has now practically passed away.</p>

<h3>E. IRVING COUSE</h3>

<p>Trained in the Paris schools, E. Irving Couse (1866-), after doing
some decorative work, devoted his attention entirely to painting the Indians
of the Southwest, depicting
rather the intimate life out of doors,
or at the peaceful occupation of
weaving, hunting, and other distractions.
He gives these canvases a
decorative treatment, and they disclose
an intimate knowledge of his
subject. Mr. Couse has a studio at
Taos, New Mexico, and is represented
in many public collections throughout
the country. Besides he has had
many medals and honors.</p>

<h3>PAINTERS OF PLAIN
AND FOREST</h3>

<p>Another artist to paint the same
sort of subject with distinguished
success is Ernest L. Blumenschein
(1874-), who began as an illustrator,
and after work at portraiture became
interested in the life of the Indian.
He too went some years ago to Taos,
where quite a colony of painters assembled.
His first important picture
to attract attention was his “Wiseman, Warrior, and Youth,” a group of
three characteristic red men. Both Mr. Couse and Mr. Blumenschein
may be said to represent the “tame” Indian; for all their canvases depict
the savages at peaceful occupations.</p>

<p>W. Herbert Dunton is still another of the Taos colony, where he
paints much of the year; though he gives attention to illustrative work
as well. He has seized upon the characteristics of the Indian with
artistic fidelity.</p>

<p>In a similar manner N. C. Wyeth,
both in painting and in illustrative work,
has been no less successful. Mr. Wyeth
was a pupil of the late Howard Pyle,
whose influence is felt strongly in his
work.</p>

<p>Other pupils of that noted illustrator
have attained distinctive positions in
portraying varied forms of Western life.
The legends and traditions of the Indian
have attracted Remington Schuyler.
The pictorial aspect of his active life in
the open, together with his contact with
wild animal life, has supplied subjects
for Philip Goodwin; while the life of the
frontiersman and the pioneer has inspired
the sturdy work of Allen True
and Harvey Dunn. These five men
have pictured the West in the same large
spirit in which their master worked
in rendering the buccaneers of the
sea and the continental soldier. Most
of the painters of the West have been
illustrators first and painters later.</p>

<p>At Cody, Wyoming, for a large part of the year lives William R.
Leigh. He was born in West Virginia in 1866. He was a pupil of the
Munich art schools, and received medals in
Paris. He has painted much of the West
that has passed,&mdash;of Indian and soldier, of
settler and cowboy, of some of the battles
of the ’60’s between the United States troops
and the savages,&mdash;and has given some
of the wonderful landscape backgrounds,
devoting no less attention to the extraordinary
local color than to the figure.</p>

<p>Edward W. Deming, who has both
painted and modeled the Indian, executed
some years ago a large decoration for the
home of Mrs. E. H. Harriman, at Arden,
New York, with the title “The Hunt,”
showing the red men after big game. Similarly
Maynard Dixon has executed decorative
work of the Indian for some California
homes. His training was through several
years of illustrative work for the magazines,
and in this work he always had a distinctly decorative composition of his
subject, though his rendering was realistic and virile.</p>

</div>

<p>Howard McCormack, who studied the Southwest as far as Mexico,
has also given attention to decorative work with the Indian for his
theme. Another who began as illustrator is J. N. Marchand, who now
paints the story-telling picture of the prospector and the cowboy. He
knows well his types and the color of their setting. The name of De Cost
Smith is frequently signed to strong Indian pictures. His “Defiance,” a
group of Indian warriors on the
crest of a hill, shown a dozen
years ago, had great vitality
and beauty. Louis Aitken was
one who had much of that
vitality and beauty&mdash;but he
passed away too early for great
fame. Another who is now
known in mural work, W. de
Leftwith Dodge, began his career
in Paris by showing in the Salon
the “Death of Minnehaha” and “Burial
of a Brave,” subjects novel to that old
art center. In recent water color exhibitions
still another illustrator, Frank Tenney
Johnson, has had many distinguished
showings of the present day Indian. His oil paintings, too, are full of the
poetry of the open. Moonlight and sun-glare are to him equally alluring.
Two painters who glory in showing vast sketches of the open, who use
the human figure, but minimize it in their pictures, are Frank Vincent Du
Mond and Fernand Lungren, both permanent residents of the Southwest.</p>

<p>All painters of the West regard that country and its life with a deep
reverence, and this feeling shows in their work. “God’s Country,”
though the familiar phrase of all, expresses their enthusiasm and their
devotion. In subject it is the most distinctly American of all themes,
and enthusiasm for the theme will go on producing the technical skill
to render it adequately.</p>

<p>Some of these later men bring to their work a technical skill perhaps
not possessed by the earlier men. Yet with this they lack some of the
convincing quality of the pioneers. For remaining traces of the picturesque
the painter of today goes to New Mexico, where he finds even
more color than farther north; but there he has to portray the arts of
peace rather than those of war. Who shall say his theme is no less satisfactory
and inspiring? Certainly not
we who have lived to see the art of
combat brought up to the nth power!</p>

<h3>THE INDIAN AS AN ART
SUBJECT</h3>

<p>There is still infinite opportunity
to make the subject of the Indian
an important factor in American art.
His decorative costume gives an element
of color, while his life of action
gives rhythm and movement, and
the background of prairie and mountain
provides dignity and grandeur
for the composition. In but little
of the mural work has this opportunity
been used, though some of the
decoration of state capitols has included isolated instances&mdash;Douglas
Volk in the Minnesota capitol being one. Lawrence C. Earle has decorated
a bank building with scenes of pioneer days. Ralph Blakelock, one
of the most individual of painters, in his best period pictured the Indian.
Elbridge A. Burbank has made
many paintings of types and representatives
of various tribes&mdash;since
1897 over 125 portraits. H. F. Farny,
who did fine illustrative work in the
’80’s, has been one of the most prolific
painters of the Indian subject. Two
of his best are “The Silent Guest”
and “Renegade Apaches.” Joseph
Henry Sharp has also been a tremendous
producer of the western life
picture. He has painted nearly one
hundred portraits of Indians and
Indian pictures for the University of
California and eleven Indian portraits
for the Smithsonian Institution,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sculptors have made ample use of
the Indian as a subject. His muscular
development, as well as his stoicism,
is a monumental quality akin
to certain aspects in the Egyptians.</p>

<p class="caption">BUFFALO HUNT. By George Catlin</p>

</div>

<p>In the art of “The Painters of Western
Life,” the artist himself plays an important
part. Remington, Schreyvogel, Russell,
and the rest were explorers and
discoverers. Someone has said that Remington
was essentially a reporter, that he
never became a “painter’s painter,” but
that he was
the people’s
favorite
through the
subjects he
chose. The
phrase, “art
for art’s sake,”
fades into the
background as
these vivid
pictures of life
in the Great
West blaze
out on the canvas.
Every
stroke of the brushes of these men shows
that they lived and did things, and that
they were more concerned about reporting
results than about methods.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>Some of the earlier attempts to picture
the West are crude, and scarcely to be
classed as art. The name of Catlin is not
even mentioned in two of the leading
standard works on American painting. He
was not a professional artist: he was a
lawyer, and he set out to explore the West
and to report on the conditions that he
found there. His pictures, therefore,
though not reckoned with as art productions,
are most valuable records. The accompanying
illustration, showing an Indian
buffalo hunt, is an example. The
scene itself is now a part of past history.
We don’t <i>hunt</i> buffaloes any more: we
<i>collect</i> them, and we regard ourselves as
very fortunate today in possessing herds
of buffalo gathered and fostered by the
public spirited liberality of Mr. William C.
Whitney and Mr. Austin Corbin.</p>

<p>Catlin was followed into the West by
men who knew much more about art
than he; but the object they all sought
was the same. Each one of them had
stories to tell of the Redman and his
life and habits, of the fights and
friendships of cavalrymen, of the adventures
of cowboys,
and in
their pictures
these subjects
were more to
them than the
purely artistic
qualities displayed
in their
representation.
There
is, of course,
much to admire
in their
art. Their execution
is vigorous,
direct and sure. But the historical
value of their paintings makes fully as
strong an appeal to us as their art interest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>The eminent art critic, Samuel Isham,
characterized Remington as an illustrator
rather than a painter. “The authoritative
chronicler,” he said, “of the whole
western land, from Assiniboine to Mexico,
and of all men and beasts dwelling therein,
is Frederic Remington. He, at least, cannot
be said to have sacrificed truth to
grace. The raw, crude light, the burning
sand, the pitiless blue sky, surround the
lank, sunburned men who ride the rough
horses, and fight, or drink, or herd cattle,
as the case may be.” Mr. Isham points
out that the work of these men might actually
lose something of their force if their
pictures were completer and more finished.
Their paintings are bold, brilliant records,
and their assembled works might well be
classed under the title that Russell gave
to his own collection: “Pictures of a West
That Has Passed.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
